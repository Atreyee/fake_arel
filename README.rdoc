== Fake_arel: Rails 3 Query Interface for Rails 2

http://github.com/gammons/fake_arel

== DESCRIPTION:

* Tired of waiting for Rails 3 and its new super-sweet query interface? Try fake_arel!

* Fake_arel is a gem that will simulate the new Rails 3 query interface, using named_scopes and a couple small patches to ActiveRecord.

* This should serve as a nice bridge between Rails 2 and Rails 3 apps, and can be removed once upgrading your app to rails 3, and everything (hopefully) should still work.

== SYNOPSIS:

* All the finders described on Pratik's blog have been implemented. (http://m.onkey.org/2010/1/22/active-record-query-interface)

    Reply.where(:id => 1)
    Reply.select("content,id").where("id > 1").order("id desc").limit(1)
    Topic.joins(:replies).limit(1)

* Additionally, named_scopes are very similar to Rails 3 relations, in that they are lazily loaded.

    >> Reply.where(:name => "John").class
    ActiveRecord::NamedScope::Scope

* Also implemented was <tt>to_sql</tt>. <tt>to_sql</tt> will work on any chained query. 
    >> Topic.joins(:replies).limit(1).to_sql
    "SELECT \"topics\".* FROM \"topics\"   INNER JOIN \"replies\" ON replies.topic_id = topics.id   LIMIT 1"

* <tt>named_scope</tt> was modified to include other <tt>named_scope</tt>s, so you can chain them together. 

    class Reply < ActiveRecord::Base
      named_scope :by_john, where(:name => "John")
      named_scope :recent, lambda {|t| where("created_at > ? ", t.minutes.ago) }
      named_scope :recent_by_john, recent(15).by_john
    end


== REQUIREMENTS:

* >= ActiveRecord 2.3.5
